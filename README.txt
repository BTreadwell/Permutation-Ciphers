***Intro
A permutation cipher is a method of encrypting data by rearranging the sequence
of characters according to a permutation. The goal of using a permutation cipher
is to secure sensitive information.

Project goals: Develop software that can encrypt and then decrypt data using a
permutation cipher; Explore and implement any preexisting code or algorithms
relating to permutation ciphers; Gain familiarity with GitHub through publishing,
updating, and maintaining project code
